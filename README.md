# Simple Blog Post RESTful API

This is simple RESTful API for managing a simple blogging platform. The core functionality of this platform includes managing blog posts and their associated comments.

## Requirements

The code is production-ready-like, and it is not intended to be in full. This project took not more than 4 hours of work.

### Data Models
- **BlogPost**: Contains a title and content. Each post can have multiple associated comments.
- **Comment**: Related to a BlogPost.

## API Endpoints

### **GET** `/api/posts`
- Returns a list of all blog posts, including their titles and the number of associated comments.

### **POST** `/api/posts`
- Creates a new blog post.

### **GET** `/api/posts/{id}`
- Retrieves a specific blog post by its ID, including its title, content, and a list of associated comments.

### **POST** `/api/posts/{id}/comments`
- Adds a new comment to a specific blog post.

## Project description

This project showcases a well-designed RESTful API that efficiently manages a simple blogging platform. The application's core functionality revolves
around creating and managing blog posts and their associated comments, making it highly intuitive for users. By following modern development
practices, such as leveraging Spring Boot 3.4.1 and Java 21, this application ensures scalability, flexibility, and compatibility with the latest
Java-based frameworks. The data modeling for **BlogPost** and **Comment** entities is straightforward yet effective, providing an excellent balance
between simplicity and functionality. API endpoints are neatly structured, allowing users to perform actions, such as retrieving data about all blog
posts or individual posts, as well as managing comments, with ease and clarity. The inclusion of endpoints to handle specific features like adding
comments to blog posts further showcases the thoughtful and user-centric design.

One of this project’s strongest points is its robust use of authentication and authorization via JWT tokens. This security mechanism ensures that
users can safely access and manage their own blog posts and comments, while preventing unauthorized interaction with others’ content. It also includes
functionality to manage users themselves, with proper restrictions to keep operations secure and as per user roles. The well-documented endpoints,
combined with the adaptable and production-like architecture, highlight its readiness for real-world deployment. Overall, this simple yet capable
blogging platform demonstrates a great blend of clean design, effective development practices, and a focus on delivering a secure and user-friendly
experience.

## Follow up

To enhance scalability and robustness, the platform can consider transitioning to a microservices' architecture. By separating core functionalities
such as managing users, blog posts, and comments into distinct services, the system can achieve better modularity and independent scaling. For
instance, the user management service could handle authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to other microservices. Similarly,
read-heavy and write-heavy operations can be decoupled into dedicated services for efficient resource allocation, reducing performance bottlenecks.
Implementing API gateways can aggregate responses from these services, ensuring that clients continue to experience a seamless interface despite the
backend complexity. This separation allows fine-grained scaling of specific components based on their workload, improving overall system performance
and resilience under a high demand scenario.

Additionally, integrating message queues such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka can significantly improve the system's ability to handle high traffic
volumes. Queues can be used to offload and manage asynchronous tasks, such as notifying users of updates or processing intensive operations, without
blocking main workflows. This will enable the API to remain responsive even during peak load conditions. Leveraging horizontal scaling for databases
and implementing caching layers for frequently accessed data, such as blog post metadata, can further optimize the system's performance. Adopting
observability practices, including distributed logging and monitoring, is also crucial to ensure the system remains robust and maintainable. These
steps, combined with a thoughtful deployment strategy using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, can set a strong foundation for handling
future growth and delivering a seamless user experience.
